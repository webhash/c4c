Unlike other small objects that would be more likely to pass normally through the digestive system if swallowed, when more than one small powerful magnet is swallowed, the magnets can attract one another while travelling through the digestive system. The magnets can then pinch together and create a blockage and slowly tear though the intestinal walls, causing perforations.\n\n The results of swallowing small powerful magnets can be very serious and life-threatening. Swallowing incidents have often resulted in considerable damage to the gastrointestinal tissues and required emergency surgical treatment. For survivors, there can be long-term health consequences.\n\n As of August 4, 2020 Showcase has received no reports of incidents or injuries related to the use of these products in Canada.\n\n Visit the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/health-canada\/services\/toy-safety\/magnets.html\"> Health Canada Advisory<\/a> for related information on magnet sets.<BR\/><b>Number sold:<\/b> \n The company reported that 154 units of the affected product were sold in Canada.<BR\/><b>Time period sold:<\/b> \n The affected products were sold in June 2020.<BR\/><b>Place of origin:<\/b> \n Manufactured in China<BR\/><b>Companies:<\/b><br\/><dl><dt>Importer<\/dt><dd>Osiris Inc. operating as Showcase<\/dd><dd>Brampton<\/dd><dd>CANADA<\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt>Manufacturer<\/dt><dd>Yiwu Yibing Import and Export Co., Ltd<\/dd><dd>Yiwu<\/dd><dd>CHINA<\/dd><\/dl>"},{"panelName":"images","title":"Images","data":[{"title":"Stucky Balls \u2013 216 Silver Powerful Rare Earth Magnets","fullUrl":"\/recall-alert-rappel-avis\/hc-sc\/2020\/assets\/RA-73665-01_s_fs_3_20200812-163130_14_en.jpg","thumbUrl":"\/recall-alert-rappel-avis\/hc-sc\/2020\/assets\/RA-73665-01_s_m_3_20200812-163130_14_en.jpg"},{"title":"Stucky Balls \u2013 216 Multi-Colour Powerful Rare Earth Magnets","fullUrl":"\/recall-alert-rappel-avis\/hc-sc\/2020\/assets\/RA-73665-02_s_fs_3_20200812-163321_15_en.jpg","thumbUrl":"\/recall-alert-rappel-avis\/hc-sc\/2020\/assets\/RA-73665-02_s_m_3_20200812-163321_15_en.jpg"}]},{"panelName":"id_numbers","title":"Identification number","text":"<b>Identification number:<\/b> RA-73665<BR\/>"}]}
